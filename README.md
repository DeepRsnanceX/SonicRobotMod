# Sonic Robot Mod

Mod that replaces the robot gamemode (globally, in any level) with a working sprite animation of ***Sonic The Hedgehog***!

The mod's settings contain a selection of a bunch of different sprites from a lot of games, like Sonic 1, 2, 3, Mania, even some from fangames!
You can access the settings via the mod page or via the game's pause menu.

Use **High Graphics** for best visual results!

## Known issues

-***Game crashes on startup with QOLMod & (i think) Prism Menu installed, ON ANDROID.*** - I have 0 clue as to why this happens and don't have neither the tools nor the knowledge to know how to fix this, if anyone that DOES can help, i'll accept any support on fixing this!!
- Dying repeatedly with very little time in-between deaths can cause sonic to show up even when he shouldn't.
- Low graphics look bad - i can't and don't wanna bother with MANUALLY porting the sheets, sorry.
- Ghost trail shows normal robot sprite - will add an option to remove it entirely in robot gamemode later.
